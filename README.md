# Machine Learning Labs 🚀

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Labs** repository! 📂 Maintained by **Abdul Ahad** (Roll no: CS-22139). This repository contains the lab exercises completed as part of the Machine Learning course.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this repository is to showcase the applications of Machine Learning concepts through practical labs. Each lab focuses on a specific aspect of Machine Learning, serving both as a learning resource and a reference for future projects.

---

## 🧪 Labs Overview
The repository includes:

- **Supervised Learning Techniques**: Hands-on experiments with algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.
- **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**: Implementations of Clustering methods like K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Exploration of techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: Building models using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Other Core Topics**: Probability distributions, evaluation metrics, and data preprocessing.

> Each exercise is implemented in **Jupyter Notebook** to provide an interactive learning experience.
